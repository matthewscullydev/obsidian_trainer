---

If the user enters free mode every reference will be turned into a string of question marks.

The user will not be asked to resolve any references. It will be up to them to enter values that resolve references.

For every string input that matches a reference will be resolved.

If the user finishes all references statistics for performance will be returned

otherwise the user can press F to finish and all references will be resolved and statstics will be returned.
