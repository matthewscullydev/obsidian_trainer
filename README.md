## Import Mindmaps
---

When importing a mindmap you will only be capable of training if every reference
has an existing markdown file.

So by default if you import a mindmap and their are only references to markdown files

Ex.)

Math.md
  [[add]]
  [[sub]]
  [[div]]
  [[mult]]

and these markdown files are nonexistant in the directory you are importing from..

The obsidian bubble graph shown will have greyed out bubbles for the nonexistant nodes.

You may train using the root node and existant subtopic nodes, but NOT using the grey nodes.
